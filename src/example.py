# The strategy is to first generate some random stages.
# Then merge them randomly into new stages in some way.
# Maybe pick two and merge.

# Note that, one CSI relation can have several stages, as in the
# paper exapmle. Maybe its more complex than that. We might have to
# absorb CSI relations and maybe other things as well. Lets see.
