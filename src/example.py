#These can also be subjects for merging but a a different level?.
# - No, must be at the same level. And the same ind pair.
# How to check minimail context/csi? 
# - Its minimal if it cant be merged, without residuals, with anything else in the set. 
#   Since then a context var would vanish.
#   minimal does not mean that it cant be absorbed.! Most are minimal I think.
#   its just if ic can be created from absorbing 2 others in the set, WITHOUT RESIDUALS, i guess. 
#   I mean exact matching absorbtion. 
#   Actually, it is minimal if ther doesnt exist any CSI which contians it, 
#   ie one with a conditioning variable instead of just a context vaariable..
#   So which I write about is that we do the merging/absorbing first, and then check this.
#   More generally, we remove one of a pair of CSIs if it is contained in the other. (this i knew before).
#
#   Our absorbtion is not only to chek for minimal CSI but also tro create new CSIs, that mey be minimal or not?

# One type of pair (X_j _|_ X_j | something) will only come from
# level j. But may come from different stages at that level.

#nodes = [("X"+str(i), "X"+str(i+1)) for i in range(1, p)]
# tree.tree.add_edges_from(nodes)
# tree.tree.add_edge("Ã˜","X1")


# The strategy is to first generate some random stages.
# Then merge them randomly into new stages in some way.
# Maybe pick two and merge.

# Note that, one CSI relation can have several stages, as in the
# paper exapmle. Maybe its more complex than that. We might have to
# absorb CSI relations and maybe other things as well. Lets see.

# Loop through all levels l
# 1. For each stage in the level do weak union to get the pairs Xi _|_ Xj | something, and group.
# 2. For each such pair go through all levels and try to find mixable CSI by partition on value.
# 3. If mixable, mix and put the result in a set woth newly created.
# 
# When we loop through al levels again by where the old CSI are not mixed with each other
# that is, each tuple needs at least one CSI from the new CSIs.
#
# Does this stop automatically? Will the set with new CSI eventually be empty?
