    A CStree on four binary random variables.



This is a Python package for CStree models :footcite:p:`duarte2021representation`, a graphical causal models that encode can context-specific information for discrete data using a proper subclass of staged tree models.
The context-specific information encoded by a CStree can be equivalently expressed via
a collection of DAGs. 


.. As not all staged tree models admit this property, CStrees are a subclass that provides a transparent, intuitive and compact representation of context-specific causal information.
