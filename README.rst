    A CStree on four binary random variables.



This is a Python package for CStree models :footcite:p:`duarte2021representation` :footcite:p:`rios2024scalable` a family of graphical causal models that encode context-specific dependence for multivariate multinomial distributions.

.. As not all staged tree models admit this property, CStrees are a subclass that provides a transparent, intuitive and compact representation of context-specific causal information.
